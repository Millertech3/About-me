# About-me
# Hi, I'm Omeji Mustapha!

I'm a passionate developer who loves solving problems and building cool things. Whether it's backend development, databases, or diving deep into authentication systems, I'm always up for a challenge.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Bash  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB (pro at it), currently exploring PostgreSQL  
- **Authentication:** bcrypt, sessions, JWT (always learning more)  
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postman  

## ðŸ“š Currently Learning

- Secure authentication practices  
- Password hashing with bcrypt  
- JWT (new but diving in!)  
- Scaling web apps and better architecture  

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

Check out some of my work in the pinned repos section! Highlights include:
- A custom authentication system using Express and bcrypt  
- A MongoDB-powered REST API  
- A CLI tool for quick file management in Bash
